            <h3 class="headers">About Me</h3>
            <p class="paragraphs">I am a sophomore pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Mathematics. 
                I plan to acquire a Master's in AI or Quantitative Finance through Northeastern's PlusOne program. 
                I'm a passionate data science and machine learning enthusiast, deeply interested in predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. 
                Since I was a child, I've had a natural affinity for sports analytics, which has developed my commitment to mastering applied mathematics and data science, where I hope to work in machine learning and quantitative finance in the future. 
                I've pursued projects showcasing my analytical skills, including predicting NBA awards using machine learning and performing sentiment analysis on large Spotify datasets. 
                I'm also actively involved in a web development project to build a schedule evaluator for Northeastern students. 
                I'm driven by a desire to uncover insights from data and contribute to impactful projects across diverse fields. 
                Growing up in Hingham, Massachusetts, I have always felt a deep connection to the rich culture and vibrant atmosphere of the Boston area. 
                My entire life has been shaped by the experiences and opportunities this region offers, from exploring the historic streets of Boston to enjoying the natural beauty of the coastal towns nearby. 
                As I transitioned into my academic career, attending Northeastern University became a dream come true.
